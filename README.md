## Design Patterns Used
- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**: Core architectural pattern for separating the user interface from business logic
- **Singleton**: Used in SupabaseService for maintaining a single instance of database connection
- **Adapter**: Implements compatibility between different interfaces, particularly for external service integration
